          <p>As my very recent coding journey progresses and deepens, I am forced to face increasingly harder questions. One that has been on the back of my mind lately is how much it is O.K.to Google for resources.
Some people say you are not supposed to memorize resources that are easily accessible via documentation, such as the difference between slice and splice in JavaScript.
Others defend that a fundamental understanding of how the basics work is required, and that there are things you should be memorizing.
Taking Codewars as an example, how O.K. is it to Google for the resources you need, versus Googling for the solution, if you get really stuck?
Personally, Googling for a solution, as long as you try to understand how it works instead of copying and pasting, can be a good thing – you might have thought of solving the problem one way and getting another perspective can be a good thing.
What I have a problem, however, is with the recurrent application of this practice.
The way I see it, and bare in mind my experience is still scarce, this would be the ideal approach:
-   Learn the fundamentals and practice them as you go. As I said in an earlier post, the sooner you get practicing, the better.
-   After getting a good grasp of the fundamentals, try some harder exercises.
-   If you get stuck, use the documentation at your disposal.
-   If you get really stuck, try Google for a solution (one that you understand and would be able to explain step by step to another person if need be).
-   Keep practicing.
If you keep getting back to the point where you have to Google for solutions all the time, or can only solve a problem by Googling each step of code you write, I would recommend going one step backwards.
Try reading about problem solving, as it applies to coding. Try breaking your problems into tinier pieces. What I usually do, specially in what katas are concerned, is make a few comments on the top, so that I can make sure that not only I understood what is being required of me, as well as the steps necessary to reach it and possible solutions to achieve it. Another thing I do, and I find tremendously helpful, is console.logging my code as I go – it allows me to get a better sense of what is going on and in some cases, even correct some mistakes.
Despite these modest best practices I have been trying to apply, people have been saying Google is my new best friend – and I don’t disagree. Why memorize some more obscure string or array methods I can easily find in the documentation, when I can apply that mental energy into learning and improving my problem solving skills, and better understand the logic behind some programming decisions?
I was reading about this topic and apparently both self-taught and experienced software developers feel haunted by the way technology has come to make out lives easier, but also harder – some of them even question if they are indeed software developers or just copy-pasters.
Which I guess is why this question bother me so. At a time I am just starting to take my first steps into this world, it seems that I have already found some pitfalls I might try to avoid.</p>
