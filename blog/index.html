        JavaScript – A Series of Unfortunate Events
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">When I set out to learn how to code (for the purpose of clarity, this means JavaScript) in the hopes of exploring a new career path I was in no way convinced it would be easy. Although my success expectations were pretty low, turns out I should have decremented them further…
I decided to Google if it is actually harder to learn as you get older (should not have done so…) and turns out there’s not a definitive or straightforward answer – but I intend to resume and deepen this research at a later time.
What I can share with you today is my own experience and what I have learned (and struggled with) so far:
 Age might not matter, but in my experience your mental and emotional state do. I started learning how to code amidst a massive changes in the working place, moving places and then relocating to a new country. I have no shame in admitting that I am one of those humans who needs some order and stability in order to learn, and to do it well. Sure, being good at Math is not a requirement for learning how to code. However, good problem solving and logic skills. Are. And you know who has lots of those? People who are good at Math… It is not to say it can’t be done – it will probably just require double the practice hours. If you are new to coding, as I am, the way you think about problems and how to go about them needs to shift. You need to learn not only to see the bigger picture, but also become really good at identifying the spots were said bigger picture can be broken down into smaller ones. I tend to make easier problems difficult just because that’s just the way I was used to go about things. If you have ever tried to learn how to play an instrument, learning how to code is actually pretty similar: you need to learn what the elements in your music sheet mean, you need to learn how to locate the notes in your instrument and then you practice until you do something that resembles music. Eventually, after many, many, many hours of practice, muscle memory kicks in and helps you a bit – but you always need to keep practicing. Learning how to code will make you question a lot of things about yourself. I though I was good at problem solving – now I have removed that from my CV until further notice. I am an experienced proof-reader and therefore attention to detail is something I proud myself on – not anymore, thanks to JavaScript (I have for sure written “length” wrong 90% of the time…). (Oh, and fun fact, I now detest my hair pins because they remind me of JavaScript’s curly braces – maybe mild trauma brewing, yet to be clarified.) Don’t rely on memorization, since repetition, though practice, seems to be far more efficient. Mix reading with practice. I hesitated (downright avoided) doing exercises for fear of being wrong and when I got around to doing them I was wrong anyways – it is easier to learn by doing. Smaller study windows, with a small break in between, tend to be more fruitful. There are a lot of great resources out there, the ones I know about and would recommend are freeCodeCamp and Codecademy. For exercises, Codewars is the most recommended one, but if like me, you find yourself struggling, try using Edabit like a stepping stone – their exercises are more bit size and they help you reframe the way you thing about problem solving before diving into the more complicated world that is Codewars. Invest on a whiteboard – as someone who is more of a visual learning, it has been a priceless resource. If you like to take notes, then take license with colour – bright colours tend to make a document come to life and more easier to read and use as a working tool for future learnings. In my personal case, I just created a simple Word document and divided it into three sections – Resources (such as freeCodeCamp), Books (some have exercises, so you can practice as you read) and Practice (note regarding exercises).  Quite frankly, at the moment I am disappointed in my progress – or lack thereof. It feels like somehow I agreed to climb Mount Everest but I am still in the airport, waiting for my gate to be announced since my plane is delayed.
Nonetheless, I am fortunate enough to have a good support system, which I don’t want to disappoint, so that’s maybe adding a bit more pressure – in a good way.
Although my progress has been painfully slow, there has been some progress, so I hope that persistence and repetition will continue to work in my favour and that I will be able to complete the mission I set myself out to complete.

        The Blank Page (no, not that one)
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">My favourite part about reading a new book has always been that blank page right before a book starts: it always feels as if I am backstage, about to peek from behind a curtain into a highly anticipated play.
I enjoy retreating into carefully crafted worlds so much that I became a writer myself.
Over the years I have learned that you don’t find your writer’s voice; you discover it, by practicing the craft, as often as one can.
For that reason, I have written fiction, poetry, press releases, a few slightly more technical documents here and there, several essays on my worries and discoveries regarding the creative process and some more tailored content, whenever I get to ghost write for others blogs.
This website is not only the way I found to showcase the range of my writing portfolio, but also an added opportunity to practice more of this craft I love so much: writing.
The first writing challenge I faced was the naming of this website: should I be an author or a writer? I decided to go with the latter, because even if I have been published in print form, I have always considered myself a writer, because – and this is merely my personal view on the subject – I use words to communicate, and that purpose can be met in a multitude of ways other than being published in a physical document.
I intend to return to this discussion in later posts, but for now I will just end this introductory piece with a quote from a book I quite enjoyed – The Muse, by Jessie Burton – that illustrates precisely this point wonderfully:
“Was the difference between being a workaday painter and being an artist simply other people believing in you, or spending twice as much money on your work?”
