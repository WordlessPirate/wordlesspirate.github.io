        &#39;Challenge Accepted&#39;
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">Yesterday, after two previous failed attempts, I managed to achieve a passing grade in a test to enroll in a coding bootcamp next December. I am happy with my – albeit small – success but if there is anything I learned from the preparation stage is that there is value in tacking a step back and taking a look at the bigger picture.
Hence, here we are. Stepping back. Looking at the bigger picture.
The first attempt, I was nervous and that hindered my performance. The second attempt, I was nervous about becoming too nervous – and you guessed it, it had a toll on how I did too.
This time, I tried my best to keep my nerves in check. I managed to do so by hiding the test’s clock. I still kept a loose track of time, but I tried to first solve the problems I know how to, then take a second take at the ones I wasn’t so sure and only then, near the end, did I consult the clock, so as to better decide where to focus my last minutes of work.
The first and second time I tried to solve the problems in front of me. I understood them and the possible steps required to solve them, but everything felt very mixed up in my head, and not so easy to access when needed. I was allowed to Google for resources but even then I felt lost.
In this last attempt, I kept track of which resources I used more in the practice exercises and made sure to bookmark them in a separate folder, meant for test day. I also took notes from some of the exercises I did – mostly things I had first done wrong and how to avoid the same mistake in the future. I even made some index cards with core concepts. I compiled and organized all the resources at my disposal and made sure they were easily accessible when it came time for the test.
The first and second time, I tried to solve the problems as a whole. Since then, I have learned that breaking complex problems into smaller, workable pieces, is not only easier, but a good practice.
In this last attempt, I made sure I took some notes from the requirements of each exercise, so as to make sure I really understood them. I also included a few possible notes about methods and tools I could possible use in that problem. I tried not to spend more than 10 minutes planning and applying my approach for each problem.
Instead of getting discouraged by the problems I was not being able to solve, and letting anger and frustration win (like I had done before), I made sure to keep going. Whenever something didn’t work, or didn’t work as expected, I tried to understand what was wrong as fix it. In this aspect, practice in Codewars was useful. Not only because of the practice in itself, but because when you solve a kata you get to see how other people solved the same problem in a myriad of ways. So even if I was not able to solve all the problems I was given, I was able to at least come up with some partial solution or in the very least plan an approach.
Maybe because I did the first two attempts of the test remotely, I did not feel so comfortable asking for help. This time, I made sure to take advantage of the help provided to me, not only in the preparation leading up to the test, but also during the test. I tried to keep my questions in the line of ‘Hey, I am stuck on X, but I was thinking that if I do Y, it might work. Am I on the right track?’ Learning to ask for help has been one of the toughest lessons in this process, but probably the one I was quicker to assimilate.
After all was said and done – or should I say coded and done (I have a ‘dad jokes’ type of humor, please forgive me) – I got to sit with the person who assisted me in my test, go through all my code, both the good and the bad, discuss and explain my approaches and thought processes, which I found to be extremely helpful.
I actually left the test with the mindset of completing the two exercises I was not able to do during the test, or at least a version of them – because work didn’t stop after passing the test, it just started.

        &#39;If you know what’s good for you…&#39;
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">I have always been puzzled by this idiom. I often like to reflect on little language oddities and reflect a bit on their true meaning, effect and power – because language is a powerful communication tool, even if nowadays the lines of what constitutes communication might be a little blurred (a subject for a later time, for sure). Basically ‘If you know what is good for you’ means that if we want to avoid certain consequences (usually getting into some kind of trouble), there is something we must do – or avoid doing, depending on the circumstances. When I was a child, if my Mother ever used this idiom, it for sure meant trouble: “Come here this instant, if you know what’s good for you…” The problem I have with this idiom is that it tends to mean the exact opposite of what it implies. It hardly ever is about something that is indeed good for us; more often than not, is someone trying to threaten us into action, which in the right context (and there are very few I would consider right) might be a good thing. For example, trying to force a friend into reason, or saying it as a light joke. Another problem I have with this idiom is the ‘if’: IF you know what’s good for you. Are we implying that most people don’t know what is good for them, or that even if they do, they dodge the responsibility – granted, some people do. As a child, this was the only phrase that came out of my Mother’s mouth that stopped me on my tracks. I knew it was not going to be good for me. I would probably be punished or grounded – which I admit, given the usually calm temperament of my mother, I most likely deserved whatever I had coming. The thing is, even as a child, this simple phrase gave me three insights: 1) My Mother hardly ever raised her voice or used threatening language, so I clearly had crossed a line. 2) It would be better to face the angry parent now then later, because punishment would be worse. 3) Because of 1 and 2, I learned the value of taking responsibility for my actions – even when it was in fact my youngest brother’s fault, but that is subject for another article. So in a way, since I DO know what is good for me – or at least I try really hard to - , I do my best to keep this idiom in mind, and the deeper meaning it holds for me.

        Measure of Success
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">I wanted to write something special for my birthday. Every year, I try to do this soul searching thing on my journal and since this year I happen to have this platform I decided to do it here.
I wanted to take a few minutes to think about how I measure success – or how I don’t actually.
I have been listening to this audiobook (an experience I plan on sharing in a later post) that mentions precisely this topic. It says, and
I am just paraphrasing here, that success depends on what we interpret as such. More often than not, success tends to be something we want to have, to attain, something that always seems to be a bit out of reach, despite our best efforts. That got me thinking. It really did. I always though of me as an ambitious person, in a good way. Can it be that I was so focused looking forward, that I forgot to look around?
My writing lately tells me just as much. I have been writing more about things I like and that I thankful for, and thinking less about what is to come. Which is a relief, because thinking about the future always gave me terrible anxiety.
That being said, if someone asked me today about my measure of success, I would say my success is measured by how thankful I am for all the things that make me happy, I guess.
The thing I find myself being more thankful for these days is time. I have had time to make the world slow down and carefully and slowly rearrange the puzzle of my existence.

        Effective Googling
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">As my very recent coding journey progresses and deepens, I am forced to face increasingly harder questions. One that has been on the back of my mind lately is how much it is O.K.to Google for resources. Some people say you are not supposed to memorize resources that are easily accessible via documentation, such as the difference between slice and splice in JavaScript. Others defend that a fundamental understanding of how the basics work is required, and that there are things you should be memorizing. Taking Codewars as an example, how O.K. is it to Google for the resources you need, versus Googling for the solution, if you get really stuck? Personally, Googling for a solution, as long as you try to understand how it works instead of copying and pasting, can be a good thing – you might have thought of solving the problem one way and getting another perspective can be a good thing. What I have a problem, however, is with the recurrent application of this practice. The way I see it, and bare in mind my experience is still scarce, this would be the ideal approach: - Learn the fundamentals and practice them as you go. As I said in an earlier post, the sooner you get practicing, the better. - After getting a good grasp of the fundamentals, try some harder exercises. - If you get stuck, use the documentation at your disposal. - If you get really stuck, try Google for a solution (one that you understand and would be able to explain step by step to another person if need be). - Keep practicing. If you keep getting back to the point where you have to Google for solutions all the time, or can only solve a problem by Googling each step of code you write, I would recommend going one step backwards. Try reading about problem solving, as it applies to coding. Try breaking your problems into tinier pieces. What I usually do, specially in what katas are concerned, is make a few comments on the top, so that I can make sure that not only I understood what is being required of me, as well as the steps necessary to reach it and possible solutions to achieve it. Another thing I do, and I find tremendously helpful, is console.logging my code as I go – it allows me to get a better sense of what is going on and in some cases, even correct some mistakes. Despite these modest best practices I have been trying to apply, people have been saying Google is my new best friend – and I don’t disagree. Why memorize some more obscure string or array methods I can easily find in the documentation, when I can apply that mental energy into learning and improving my problem solving skills, and better understand the logic behind some programming decisions? I was reading about this topic and apparently both self-taught and experienced software developers feel haunted by the way technology has come to make out lives easier, but also harder – some of them even question if they are indeed software developers or just copy-pasters. Which I guess is why this question bother me so. At a time I am just starting to take my first steps into this world, it seems that I have already found some pitfalls I might try to avoid.

        Is the pen mightier than the keyboard?
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">Recently, I found myself debating with my Significant Other the advantages of writing by hand. Born in the mid 80’s, my relation to technology is a bit unusual, I believe. There was no computer in the household at least until I was 16. Around the same time I got my first phone. I was never too attached to technology – in fact, at a certain point I might have even despise it, as soon as the proliferation of cell phones meant my usually quiet reading time was perturbed by increasingly more frequent and persistent beeps, as sms text messaging became more and more of a thing. When I got to college I started my first blog and experience some moderate success, which helped pave the way for my future writing endeavours. I was never without my notebook, though. Much like Margaret Atwood, “My absolute opening entry is always a handheld object with a point on one end. (…) I think that people should carry notebooks with them at all times just for those moments because there’s nothing worse than having that moment and finding that you’re unable to set it down except with a knife on your leg or something.” For years and years, I had notebooks and journals. I had one for more private, quiet at home thoughts and another I called my “travel log”, which I used to carry with me at all times, as I was a at least five hours a day commuter at the time. I wrote everywhere for no particular reason other than it felt good to write. It kept me sharp at my job as a copywriter, it kept me creative because I kept flexing those creative muscles every day, several times a day. Although unable to say when I stopped writing in my notebooks, I would say it was around the time I decided I needed to be more practical and that writing on paper and then passing it to digital form was taking too much of my time – which it was. It is only ironical that today I am writing this text in digital form while praising the benefits of handwriting, but the truth of the matter is, both methods have their advantages and caveats. A quick look at the science behind this, particularly at one study conducted at Indiana University, tells us there is at least some difference. Using an MRI that sports neural activity in the brain, they were able to prove that kids who had practice writing letters by hand and kids that were simply shown letters showed different results; the first group’s neural activity was far more advanced. Another study conducted in Sweden took a more detailed approached and examined results from three different sources: pen and paper, tablet and tablet with speech synthesis, and how secondary students interacted with these learning tools. It is not surprising that using a tablet, or a tablet with speech synthesis, might allow students to write in a more grammarly accurate fashion. However, when we take a look at text structure, those writing using pen and paper actually produced best structured work. Not only that, but the main difference observed was that “(…) material processes dominated when students wrote digitally and that mental, verbal, and relational processes dominated when they wrote by hand.” Although the others of this study admit more research on the topic is needed, there were nonetheless able to reach quite interesting further questions on this fascinating topic. Other pieces online also focus on the neuroscience: how pen and paper tend paper tend to have a greater impact on brain development, fostering greater emotional involvement and thus a better understanding of emotional processes; with this, also a stronger understanding of conceptual, abstract ideas. As far I am concerned, I am trying to re-establish my pen in hand, notebook in the bag old ways, since I do believe there is something special about putting pen to paper. Might be nostalgia, might be sentimentalism, but whatever it is, I do believe that personally, it makes me not only a better writer, but also a more creative human in general – let’s see if the next few posts might me able to sustain this theory of mine.

        How music affects Learning
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">If you ever worked in an office with an open floor plan, you probably know that sometimes headphones are your best friends. My tasks involved highly detailed documents, with several fields and values to consider, so having the ability to concentrate was key. The way I do so is with music, and I have a few favourites, or at least favourites I know help me concentrate better: classical musical (I prefer Beethoven piano concertos or Chopin’s Polonaises), epic music (inspiring, lyric free, call to battle kind of stuff), epic vocals (akin do Celtic music but no lyrics, just vocalization) and my most recent favourite, binaural beats.
I came across these last ones on a particularly noisy office day. I simply searched “music focus concentration” and there they were. But what are they? Do they really improve concentration? I did a Google deep dive to try and find out. There are no conclusive reports (more research studies need to be conducted) and the topics below are simply what I thought were most interesting/helpful.
In short, binaural beats is a form of soundwave therapy. It makes you listen to two slightly different frequency tones in your right and left ears, but those tones are perceived as one. Said frequency should be lower than 1000 hertz for the brain to detect the binaural beat. There is a wide range of binaural beats available, each for a specific purpose, such as but not limited to, dreamless sleep, meditation, creativity, relaxation, concentration and alertness – the frequency is different depending on what you are trying to achieve. Some of the possible positive effects are reduced stress and anxiety and an increase in concentration and confidence.
My Google deep dive also led me to research what effect music in general can have in learning, and how “The Mozart Effect” seems to actually be a thing. Apparently listing to classical music can indeed increase your accuracy, improve your longer-lasting recall memory and even improve your problem solving skills.
As far as I am concerned, music is a key element to everything I do: from writing to studying, to running, to cleaning the house. In my case, it helps me feel focus and on task – and I am so glad that science can (even if not conclusively) prove my defence of music as a catalyser for productivity and overall better mental health.

        Seeking Clarity
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">There is a quote that I quite like and that it has been on my mind lately:
“Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not.”
It is from a book called Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World, by Cal Newport. (Great book, highly recommend it.)
I have quite big plans for the upcoming months so clarity is not only a necessity, it is a requirement.
Over the course of the last few years I have made some changes - some conscious some unconscious - about the way I deal with health, technology and clutter, among other things. I sometimes purposefully unplug from social tools. I tend to be organized in a way I was not before – I try to not only have less things, but also make sure the things I do have and the way I store them is functional (3 house moves and a country relocation in the span of 7 years tend to put things into perspective).
What I still struggle with is what Carl Newport speaks about in further depth in his book; in my own words, the ability to do more in less time and the ability to complete a task without being distracted by another – as a writer, this sometimes is hard, since you may have a new idea while working on another one. So how do I do this? How do I focus, how to I get the clarity I need?
The answers came in the form of a kitchen timer. You most probably heard about this before: the Pomodoro technique. This time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo is genius in its simplicity. Take a timer, set it for 25 minutes, and focus on your task. Take small breaks in between tasks and a longer break every 4 or so Pomodoro. Adapt it to your needs, if you prefer – I personally prefer 10 minutes for writing and 30 minutes for studying, for instance.
This technique is highly motivating because you get to see immediate results. In my case, the word count for 10 minutes sets as almost doubled. I tend to not feel so overwhelmed by my tasks because I know there is a small break in between them. It is also a nice way to make sure you are not getting lost in the tasks at hand.
For example, if I am focusing on a particular problem for more than 15 minutes without being able to solve it, I might as well move on to something else, get it done, and come back to my more difficult problem at a later time – a few wins will make feel better and hence enhance my probability of success in the more difficult problem.

        Cause &amp; Effect
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">I am trying to implement some big changes in my life, one of those being a complete career overhaul. This implies time, a fresh mind and focus. For quite a while, time was not a luxury I had. Now that I do, I find myself battling my own memory.
Did I forget how to learn? Is the way I learn wrong? Yes and no. The change I am aiming for is quite drastic in nature and yes, the way I learn has to change. And it is not that I forgot how to learn, it is just a skill that needs to be exercised once in a while – you can be the most fit person in the world, but nobody runs a marathon without the proper preparation (at least I hope they don’t, the possibility for injury is tremendous).
Come to think of it, and keeping up with this analogy, this might just be the root of the problem: I got injured. I had a lot on my plate and although my body was giving me all the signs, I brushed them off as fatigue and kept going as though I had something to prove. Which I probably did, since I am highly competitive, especially with myself.
Some time ago I attended a Mindfulness seminar. I am not going to bore you with details, but the purpose of mindfulness is to help you be present, in the moment and in your own body, through meditation and other techniques. As our coach walked us through some of the instructions, like “let yourself feel your body” I was surprised to find out how tired and sore my body was. And how that was a reflection of how my mind was feeling.
A lot is said about stress and burn out, but the fact is that very little is done about it. Because stress, in small doses, is a good thing. It pushes your creative limits. Gives you that “ I beat the clock high”. But much like sugar (a topic for another discussion), stress is a silent killer. It does not kill you literally, but it eats at you and robs you of things.
I was recently reading about this topic and some researchers managed to prove that stress, in the long term, shrinks the brain, so each time you have a crisis you are lesser and lesser equipped to deal with the stress. It also makes the heart work too hard for too long. Causes headaches and intense fatigue. It messes up your sleep and your ability to concentrate. Also attacks your stomach and can affect your irritability. For all these reasons and a couple more, stress is linked to depression, also.
The way I see it now, stress is not something to be messed with. If you see yourself in a situation that causes your health to decline, remove yourself from it. Or if you are not able to, at least try and find strategies to cope or manage it.
As for my personal strategies, so far writing, time management and some exercise seem to be helping - but I still have a long way to go.

        Jump-Start Writing Hacks
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">Recently I was given the gift of Spotify. Which is great, because I use music for pretty much everything: yoga, running, writing… And since I have been trying to get the most out of my time, I have now taken a liking to podcasts – a bit late for the party, I know, but better late than never, right?
Podcasts are a great way to get some information in your brain almost without realising it. I had an idea for this precise article while listening to two episodes of two separate podcasts, while doing chores around the house – so although I wasn’t giving it my full attention, I still managed to retain some pertinent information. (This is fascinating to me, so do expect some learning about learning posts in the future.)
So, the podcasts in question are Writer’s Group Therapy and Writer’s Routine, specifically Session 5 and #20, respectively. Both great podcasts, worth giving them a listen. (I am currently going over quite a few podcasts on Writing, so I might write about this is further detail soon).
In Session 5, the hosts talk about strategies to overcome the dreaded Writer’s Block. First of all, having other people discuss it makes me feel less bad. I tend to self-deprecate whenever I get stuck and eventually you get so stuck on being stuck that you just… get stucker, I guess.
As for the Writer’s Routine #20, the host brings us insights of writer Anthony Horowitz’s routine. One of the things that stuck with me is that Horowitz says he tries to keep his routine as diversified as he can, because writing in itself (as much as we love it) is quite a monotonous mechanical task, so he tries to keep everything else loosey loose. Another thing he also shared is that he tries to keep his office as geared towards his writing activities as possible, so that he can just get started without losing too much time.
As someone who has struggled quite intensely with writer’s block, hearing other writer’s experiences, specially from different kinds of writers – authors, screenwriters – just puts everything into perspective.
Other than the podcasts, there are also other techniques you can use to jump-start your writing if you feel stuck, such as but not limited to:
 Change it up, go write somewhere else: a coffee shop, a garden, a library, an arcade, anywhere you think you might get some words in. Makes you feel uncomfortable? Write about that. Nowadays there are some specific products geared at writers, such as the Writer Emergency Pack, which contains Idea Cards and Detail Cards. There are also some writing related games out there (I have Paperback on my shelves, for instance) and some games that although not specifically writing related, are still helpful, such as Story Cubes (which have several different sets, with different themes). Go on YouTube and watch some videos. A while ago I watched one of those screenwriter’s round tables and somebody told a story about a writer who, in order not to lose focus on current work but still won’t waste new ideas that would come up, would jot those ideas down on index card and throw them in an idea box, for future use.  These are just some suggestions, I am sure there are many more, and probably more effective. If there is any strong point I want to get across with this small entry, is that the best way to get over writer’s block is to write – and learning to be comfortable in producing quite horrible writing in the process. Writing is mostly perseverance in the face of a terrifying blank page.

        Relocation
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">There is this really cool online tool called Wolfram Alpha – basically a Mathematical Oracle built by very smart people – that I tend to use when I want to have a more numerical notion of time. Today, I used it to check how many days since I relocated from Portugal to the United Kingdom. It’s been 38 days. A month and a week.
I am lucky enough to already have a support system in place in the country I relocated to, which makes things easier. After over 1000 days away from my Significant Other, it feels like a great gift for us to be reunited again.
At the moment, I am studying and practicing in order to apply for a software developer camp, which hopefully will open some new career doors.
I went from a full-time job to a full-time student and though this condition might seem enviable my many, I assure you – it is not. Learning how to code is difficult and on top of that, I now have to deal with the physical and mental backlash of what stress has been doing to my body over the last few years. (Let’s just say that this relocation is the search of a better life in more ways than one.)
I plan on using this time and the opportunities placed before me wisely.

        Technical Writing
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">Technical writing is one of the subjects I have been looking into more detail lately. It can take many types and forms, but more often than not, it is meant to describe a set of instructions or findings. It can be anything, from the instructions in your new appliance to a thoroughly researched paper on the effects of healthy eating in cancer patients.
A while ago I was working on a project – a simple step-by-step guide for very minor IT issues – and as I was doing so, I was also researching the best way to do go about it. I did not want my project to be a simple collage of print screens. I wanted an order, a structure, a purpose (and a dynamic index, that would make accessing all the compiled information a lot easier).
Little by little, it dawned on me that I was venturing into the realm of technical writing, which scared me a little. Having my project considered a good example of &amp;ldquo;technical writing&amp;rdquo; gave it additional credibility, but also an additional layer of responsibility over its content.
So, I did what any writer (technical or not) would do. I reinforced my research, referenced my sources and sought out similar examples to what I was trying to build.
My project fits into the realm of instructional manuals/user guides, so I tried to be as descriptive as possible – both in text and print screens – and include step-by-step instructions. I even tested out some earlier versions of my project with some colleagues, to see if there was too much or too little information – and adjusted according to their feedback.
Structuring the document was probably the hardest part. I decided to list the issues by order of occurrence, since it was what it made more sense at the time.
Working on this project was very fruitful for me, as it allowed me to have a much deeper understanding of technical writing – and how hard it is to do it right!

        JavaScript – A Series of Unfortunate Events
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">When I set out to learn how to code (for the purpose of clarity, this means JavaScript) in the hopes of exploring a new career path I was in no way convinced it would be easy. Although my success expectations were pretty low, turns out I should have decremented them further…
I decided to Google if it is actually harder to learn as you get older (should not have done so…) and turns out there’s not a definitive or straightforward answer – but I intend to resume and deepen this research at a later time.
What I can share with you today is my own experience and what I have learned (and struggled with) so far:
 Age might not matter, but in my experience your mental and emotional state do. I started learning how to code amidst a massive changes in the working place, moving places and then relocating to a new country. I have no shame in admitting that I am one of those humans who needs some order and stability in order to learn, and to do it well. Sure, being good at Math is not a requirement for learning how to code. However, good problem solving and logic skills. Are. And you know who has lots of those? People who are good at Math… It is not to say it can’t be done – it will probably just require double the practice hours. If you are new to coding, as I am, the way you think about problems and how to go about them needs to shift. You need to learn not only to see the bigger picture, but also become really good at identifying the spots were said bigger picture can be broken down into smaller ones. I tend to make easier problems difficult just because that’s just the way I was used to go about things. If you have ever tried to learn how to play an instrument, learning how to code is actually pretty similar: you need to learn what the elements in your music sheet mean, you need to learn how to locate the notes in your instrument and then you practice until you do something that resembles music. Eventually, after many, many, many hours of practice, muscle memory kicks in and helps you a bit – but you always need to keep practicing. Learning how to code will make you question a lot of things about yourself. I though I was good at problem solving – now I have removed that from my CV until further notice. I am an experienced proof-reader and therefore attention to detail is something I proud myself on – not anymore, thanks to JavaScript (I have for sure written “length” wrong 90% of the time…). (Oh, and fun fact, I now detest my hair pins because they remind me of JavaScript’s curly braces – maybe mild trauma brewing, yet to be clarified.) Don’t rely on memorization, since repetition, though practice, seems to be far more efficient. Mix reading with practice. I hesitated (downright avoided) doing exercises for fear of being wrong and when I got around to doing them I was wrong anyways – it is easier to learn by doing. Smaller study windows, with a small break in between, tend to be more fruitful. There are a lot of great resources out there, the ones I know about and would recommend are freeCodeCamp and Codecademy. For exercises, Codewars is the most recommended one, but if like me, you find yourself struggling, try using Edabit like a stepping stone – their exercises are more bit size and they help you reframe the way you thing about problem solving before diving into the more complicated world that is Codewars. Invest on a whiteboard – as someone who is more of a visual learning, it has been a priceless resource. If you like to take notes, then take license with colour – bright colours tend to make a document come to life and more easier to read and use as a working tool for future learnings. In my personal case, I just created a simple Word document and divided it into three sections – Resources (such as freeCodeCamp), Books (some have exercises, so you can practice as you read) and Practice (note regarding exercises).  Quite frankly, at the moment I am disappointed in my progress – or lack thereof. It feels like somehow I agreed to climb Mount Everest but I am still in the airport, waiting for my gate to be announced since my plane is delayed.
Nonetheless, I am fortunate enough to have a good support system, which I don’t want to disappoint, so that’s maybe adding a bit more pressure – in a good way.
Although my progress has been painfully slow, there has been some progress, so I hope that persistence and repetition will continue to work in my favour and that I will be able to complete the mission I set myself out to complete.

        The Blank Page (no, not that one)
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">My favourite part about reading a new book has always been that blank page right before a book starts: it always feels as if I am backstage, about to peek from behind a curtain into a highly anticipated play.
I enjoy retreating into carefully crafted worlds so much that I became a writer myself.
Over the years I have learned that you don’t find your writer’s voice; you discover it, by practicing the craft, as often as one can.
For that reason, I have written fiction, poetry, press releases, a few slightly more technical documents here and there, several essays on my worries and discoveries regarding the creative process and some more tailored content, whenever I get to ghost write for others blogs.
This website is not only the way I found to showcase the range of my writing portfolio, but also an added opportunity to practice more of this craft I love so much: writing.
The first writing challenge I faced was the naming of this website: should I be an author or a writer? I decided to go with the latter, because even if I have been published in print form, I have always considered myself a writer, because – and this is merely my personal view on the subject – I use words to communicate, and that purpose can be met in a multitude of ways other than being published in a physical document.
I intend to return to this discussion in later posts, but for now I will just end this introductory piece with a quote from a book I quite enjoyed – The Muse, by Jessie Burton – that illustrates precisely this point wonderfully:
“Was the difference between being a workaday painter and being an artist simply other people believing in you, or spending twice as much money on your work?”
