        Jump-Start Writing Hacks
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">Recently I was given the gift of Spotify. Which is great, because I use music for pretty much everything: yoga, running, writing… And since I have been trying to get the most out of my time, I have now taken a liking to podcasts – a bit late for the party, I know, but better late than never, right?
Podcasts are a great way to get some information in your brain almost without realising it. I had an idea for this precise article while listening to two episodes of two separate podcasts, while doing chores around the house – so although I wasn’t giving it my full attention, I still managed to retain some pertinent information. (This is fascinating to me, so do expect some learning about learning posts in the future.)
So, the podcasts in question are Writer’s Group Therapy and Writer’s Routine, specifically Session 5 and #20, respectively. Both great podcasts, worth giving them a listen. (I am currently going over quite a few podcasts on Writing, so I might write about this is further detail soon).
In Session 5, the hosts talk about strategies to overcome the dreaded Writer’s Block. First of all, having other people discuss it makes me feel less bad. I tend to self-deprecate whenever I get stuck and eventually you get so stuck on being stuck that you just… get stucker, I guess.
As for the Writer’s Routine #20, the host brings us insights of writer Anthony Horowitz’s routine. One of the things that stuck with me is that Horowitz says he tries to keep his routine as diversified as he can, because writing in itself (as much as we love it) is quite a monotonous mechanical task, so he tries to keep everything else loosey loose. Another thing he also shared is that he tries to keep his office as geared towards his writing activities as possible, so that he can just get started without losing too much time.
As someone who has struggled quite intensely with writer’s block, hearing other writer’s experiences, specially from different kinds of writers – authors, screenwriters – just puts everything into perspective.
Other than the podcasts, there are also other techniques you can use to jump-start your writing if you feel stuck, such as but not limited to:
 Change it up, go write somewhere else: a coffee shop, a garden, a library, an arcade, anywhere you think you might get some words in. Makes you feel uncomfortable? Write about that.  Nowadays there are some specific products geared at writers, such as the Writer Emergency Pack, which contains Idea Cards and Detail Cards.  There are also some writing related games out there (I have Paperback on my shelves, for instance) and some games that although not specifically writing related, are still helpful, such as Story Cubes (which have several different sets, with different themes).  Go on YouTube and watch some videos. A while ago I watched one of those screenwriter’s round tables and somebody told a story about a writer who, in order not to lose focus on current work but still won’t waste new ideas that would come up, would jot those ideas down on index card and throw them in an idea box, for future use.
These are just some suggestions, I am sure there are many more, and probably more effective. If there is any strong point I want to get across with this small entry, is that the best way to get over writer’s block is to write – and learning to be comfortable in producing quite horrible writing in the process. Writing is mostly perseverance in the face of a terrifying blank page.

        Relocation
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">There is this really cool online tool called Wolfram Alpha – basically a Mathematical Oracle built by very smart people – that I tend to use when I want to have a more numerical notion of time. Today, I used it to check how many days since I relocated from Portugal to the United Kingdom. It’s been 38 days. A month and a week.
I am lucky enough to already have a support system in place in the country I relocated to, which makes things easier. After over 1000 days away from my Significant Other, it feels like a great gift for us to be reunited again.
At the moment, I am studying and practicing in order to apply for a software developer camp, which hopefully will open some new career doors.
I went from a full-time job to a full-time student and though this condition might seem enviable my many, I assure you – it is not. Learning how to code is difficult and on top of that, I now have to deal with the physical and mental backlash of what stress has been doing to my body over the last few years. (Let’s just say that this relocation is the search of a better life in more ways than one.)
I plan on using this time and the opportunities placed before me wisely.

        Technical Writing
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">Technical writing is one of the subjects I have been looking into more detail lately. It can take many types and forms, but more often than not, it is meant to describe a set of instructions or findings. It can be anything, from the instructions in your new appliance to a thoroughly researched paper on the effects of healthy eating in cancer patients.
A while ago I was working on a project – a simple step-by-step guide for very minor IT issues – and as I was doing so, I was also researching the best way to do go about it. I did not want my project to be a simple collage of print screens. I wanted an order, a structure, a purpose (and a dynamic index, that would make accessing all the compiled information a lot easier).
Little by little, it dawned on me that I was venturing into the realm of technical writing, which scared me a little. Having my project considered a good example of &amp;ldquo;technical writing&amp;rdquo; gave it additional credibility, but also an additional layer of responsibility over its content.
So, I did what any writer (technical or not) would do. I reinforced my research, referenced my sources and sought out similar examples to what I was trying to build.
My project fits into the realm of instructional manuals/user guides, so I tried to be as descriptive as possible – both in text and print screens – and include step-by-step instructions. I even tested out some earlier versions of my project with some colleagues, to see if there was too much or too little information – and adjusted according to their feedback.
Structuring the document was probably the hardest part. I decided to list the issues by order of occurrence, since it was what it made more sense at the time.
Working on this project was very fruitful for me, as it allowed me to have a much deeper understanding of technical writing – and how hard it is to do it right!

        JavaScript – A Series of Unfortunate Events
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">When I set out to learn how to code (for the purpose of clarity, this means JavaScript) in the hopes of exploring a new career path I was in no way convinced it would be easy. Although my success expectations were pretty low, turns out I should have decremented them further…
I decided to Google if it is actually harder to learn as you get older (should not have done so…) and turns out there’s not a definitive or straightforward answer – but I intend to resume and deepen this research at a later time.
What I can share with you today is my own experience and what I have learned (and struggled with) so far:
 Age might not matter, but in my experience your mental and emotional state do. I started learning how to code amidst a massive changes in the working place, moving places and then relocating to a new country. I have no shame in admitting that I am one of those humans who needs some order and stability in order to learn, and to do it well. Sure, being good at Math is not a requirement for learning how to code. However, good problem solving and logic skills. Are. And you know who has lots of those? People who are good at Math… It is not to say it can’t be done – it will probably just require double the practice hours. If you are new to coding, as I am, the way you think about problems and how to go about them needs to shift. You need to learn not only to see the bigger picture, but also become really good at identifying the spots were said bigger picture can be broken down into smaller ones. I tend to make easier problems difficult just because that’s just the way I was used to go about things. If you have ever tried to learn how to play an instrument, learning how to code is actually pretty similar: you need to learn what the elements in your music sheet mean, you need to learn how to locate the notes in your instrument and then you practice until you do something that resembles music. Eventually, after many, many, many hours of practice, muscle memory kicks in and helps you a bit – but you always need to keep practicing. Learning how to code will make you question a lot of things about yourself. I though I was good at problem solving – now I have removed that from my CV until further notice. I am an experienced proof-reader and therefore attention to detail is something I proud myself on – not anymore, thanks to JavaScript (I have for sure written “length” wrong 90% of the time…). (Oh, and fun fact, I now detest my hair pins because they remind me of JavaScript’s curly braces – maybe mild trauma brewing, yet to be clarified.) Don’t rely on memorization, since repetition, though practice, seems to be far more efficient. Mix reading with practice. I hesitated (downright avoided) doing exercises for fear of being wrong and when I got around to doing them I was wrong anyways – it is easier to learn by doing. Smaller study windows, with a small break in between, tend to be more fruitful. There are a lot of great resources out there, the ones I know about and would recommend are freeCodeCamp and Codecademy. For exercises, Codewars is the most recommended one, but if like me, you find yourself struggling, try using Edabit like a stepping stone – their exercises are more bit size and they help you reframe the way you thing about problem solving before diving into the more complicated world that is Codewars. Invest on a whiteboard – as someone who is more of a visual learning, it has been a priceless resource. If you like to take notes, then take license with colour – bright colours tend to make a document come to life and more easier to read and use as a working tool for future learnings. In my personal case, I just created a simple Word document and divided it into three sections – Resources (such as freeCodeCamp), Books (some have exercises, so you can practice as you read) and Practice (note regarding exercises).  Quite frankly, at the moment I am disappointed in my progress – or lack thereof. It feels like somehow I agreed to climb Mount Everest but I am still in the airport, waiting for my gate to be announced since my plane is delayed.
Nonetheless, I am fortunate enough to have a good support system, which I don’t want to disappoint, so that’s maybe adding a bit more pressure – in a good way.
Although my progress has been painfully slow, there has been some progress, so I hope that persistence and repetition will continue to work in my favour and that I will be able to complete the mission I set myself out to complete.

        The Blank Page (no, not that one)
      </h3>
      <p class="summary-summary">My favourite part about reading a new book has always been that blank page right before a book starts: it always feels as if I am backstage, about to peek from behind a curtain into a highly anticipated play.
I enjoy retreating into carefully crafted worlds so much that I became a writer myself.
Over the years I have learned that you don’t find your writer’s voice; you discover it, by practicing the craft, as often as one can.
For that reason, I have written fiction, poetry, press releases, a few slightly more technical documents here and there, several essays on my worries and discoveries regarding the creative process and some more tailored content, whenever I get to ghost write for others blogs.
This website is not only the way I found to showcase the range of my writing portfolio, but also an added opportunity to practice more of this craft I love so much: writing.
The first writing challenge I faced was the naming of this website: should I be an author or a writer? I decided to go with the latter, because even if I have been published in print form, I have always considered myself a writer, because – and this is merely my personal view on the subject – I use words to communicate, and that purpose can be met in a multitude of ways other than being published in a physical document.
I intend to return to this discussion in later posts, but for now I will just end this introductory piece with a quote from a book I quite enjoyed – The Muse, by Jessie Burton – that illustrates precisely this point wonderfully:
“Was the difference between being a workaday painter and being an artist simply other people believing in you, or spending twice as much money on your work?”
