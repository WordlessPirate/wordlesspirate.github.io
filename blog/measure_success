I wanted to write something special for my birthday. Every year, I try to do this soul searching thing on my journal and since this year I happen to have this platform I decided to do it here.
I wanted to take a few minutes to think about how I measure success – or how I don’t actually.
I have been listening to this audiobook (an experience I plan on sharing in a later post) that mentions precisely this topic. It says, and I am just paraphrasing here, that success depends on what we interpret as such. More often than not, success tends to be something we want to have, to attain, something that always seems to be a bit out of reach, despite our best efforts.
That got me thinking. It really did. I always though of me as an ambitious person, in a good way. Can it be that I was so focused looking forward, that I forgot to look around?
My writing lately tells me just as much. I have been writing more about things I like and that I thankful for, and thinking less about what is to come. Which is a relief, because thinking about the future always gave me terrible anxiety.
That being said, if someone asked me today about my measure of success, I would say my success is measured by how thankful I am for all the things that make me happy, I guess.
The thing I find myself being more thankful for these days is time. I have had time to make the world slow down and carefully and slowly rearrange the puzzle of my existence.
