          <p>Yesterday, after two previous failed attempts, I managed to achieve a passing grade in a test to enroll in a coding bootcamp next December.
I am happy with my – albeit small – success but if there is anything I learned from the preparation stage is that there is value in tacking a step back and taking a look at the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Hence, here we are. Stepping back. Looking at the bigger picture.</p>

<p>The first attempt, I was nervous and that hindered my performance. The second attempt, I was nervous about becoming too nervous – and you guessed it, it had a toll on how I did too.</p>

<p>This time, I tried my best to keep my nerves in check. I managed to do so by hiding the test’s clock. I still kept a loose track of time, but I tried to first solve the problems I know how to, then take a second take at the ones I wasn’t so sure and only then, near the end, did I consult the clock, so as to better decide where to focus my last minutes of work.</p>

<p>The first and second time I tried to solve the problems in front of me. I understood them and the possible steps required to solve them, but everything felt very mixed up in my head, and not so easy to access when needed. I was allowed to Google for resources but even then I felt lost.</p>

<p>In this last attempt, I kept track of which resources I used more in the practice exercises and made sure to bookmark them in a separate folder, meant for test day. I also took notes from some of the exercises I did – mostly things I had first done wrong and how to avoid the same mistake in the future. I even made some index cards with core concepts. I compiled and organized all the resources at my disposal and made sure they were easily accessible when it came time for the test.</p>

<p>The first and second time, I tried to solve the problems as a whole. Since then, I have learned that breaking complex problems into smaller, workable pieces, is not only easier, but a good practice.</p>

<p>In this last attempt, I made sure I took some notes from the requirements of each exercise, so as to make sure I really understood them. I also included a few possible notes about methods and tools I could possible use in that problem. I tried not to spend more than 10 minutes planning and applying my approach for each problem.</p>

<p>Instead of getting discouraged by the problems I was not being able to solve, and letting anger and frustration win (like I had done before), I made sure to keep going. Whenever something didn’t work, or didn’t work as expected, I tried to understand what was wrong as fix it. In this aspect, practice in Codewars was useful. Not only because of the practice in itself, but because when you solve a kata you get to see how other people solved the same problem in a myriad of ways. So even if I was not able to solve all the problems I was given, I was able to at least come up with some partial solution or in the very least plan an approach.</p>

<p>Maybe because I did the first two attempts of the test remotely, I did not feel so comfortable asking for help. This time, I made sure to take advantage of the help provided to me, not only in the preparation leading up to the test, but also during the test. I tried to keep my questions in the line of ‘Hey, I am stuck on X, but I was thinking that if I do Y, it might work. Am I on the right track?’ Learning to ask for help has been one of the toughest lessons in this process, but probably the one I was quicker to assimilate.</p>

<p>After all was said and done – or should I say coded and done (I have a ‘dad jokes’ type of humor, please forgive me) – I got to sit with the person who assisted me in my test, go through all my code, both the good and the bad, discuss and explain my approaches and thought processes, which I found to be extremely helpful.</p>

<p>I actually left the test with the mindset of completing the two exercises I was not able to do during the test, or at least a version of them – because work didn’t stop after passing the test, it just started.</p>
