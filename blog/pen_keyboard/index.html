          <p>Recently, I found myself debating with my Significant Other the advantages of writing by hand. Born in the mid 80’s, my relation to technology is a bit unusual, I believe. There was no computer in the household at least until I was 16. Around the same time I got my first phone. I was never too attached to technology – in fact, at a certain point I might have even despise it, as soon as the proliferation of cell phones meant my usually quiet reading time was perturbed by increasingly more frequent and persistent beeps, as sms text messaging became more and more of a thing.
When I got to college I started my first blog and experience some moderate success, which helped pave the way for my future writing endeavours. I was never without my notebook, though. Much like Margaret Atwood, “My absolute opening entry is always a handheld object with a point on one end. (…) I think that people should carry notebooks with them at all times just for those moments because there’s nothing worse than having that moment and finding that you’re unable to set it down except with a knife on your leg or something.”
For years and years, I had notebooks and journals. I had one for more private, quiet at home thoughts and another I called my “travel log”, which I used to carry with me at all times, as I was a at least five hours a day commuter at the time.
I wrote everywhere for no particular reason other than it felt good to write. It kept me sharp at my job as a copywriter, it kept me creative because I kept flexing those creative muscles every day, several times a day.
Although unable to say when I stopped writing in my notebooks, I would say it was around the time I decided I needed to be more practical and that writing on paper and then passing it to digital form was taking too much of my time – which it was.
It is only ironical that today I am writing this text in digital form while praising the benefits of handwriting, but the truth of the matter is, both methods have their advantages and caveats.
A quick look at the science behind this, particularly at one study conducted at Indiana University, tells us there is at least some difference. Using an MRI that sports neural activity in the brain, they were able to prove that kids who had practice writing letters by hand and kids that were simply shown letters showed different results; the first group’s neural activity was far more advanced.
Another study conducted in Sweden took a more detailed approached and examined results from three different sources: pen and paper, tablet and tablet with speech synthesis, and how secondary students interacted with these learning tools. It is not surprising that using a tablet, or a tablet with speech synthesis, might allow students to write in a more grammarly accurate fashion. However, when we take a look at text structure, those writing using pen and paper actually produced best structured work. Not only that, but the main difference observed was that “(…) material processes dominated when students wrote digitally and that mental, verbal, and relational processes dominated when they wrote by hand.”
Although the others of this study admit more research on the topic is needed, there were nonetheless able to reach quite interesting further questions on this fascinating topic.
Other pieces online also focus on the neuroscience: how pen and paper tend paper tend to have a greater impact on brain development, fostering greater emotional involvement and thus a better understanding of emotional processes; with this, also a stronger understanding of conceptual, abstract ideas.
As far I am concerned, I am trying to re-establish my pen in hand, notebook in the bag old ways, since I do believe there is something special about putting pen to paper. Might be nostalgia, might be sentimentalism, but whatever it is, I do believe that personally, it makes me not only a better writer, but also a more creative human in general – let’s see if the next few posts might me able to sustain this theory of mine.</p>
